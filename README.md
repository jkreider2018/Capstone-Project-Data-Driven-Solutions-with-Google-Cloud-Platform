# Leveraging GCP to Analyze and Predict the S&P 500

## Capstone Project Data Driven Solutions with Google Cloud Platform: Group 6 - John Kreider, Jacob Michaels, Daelano Pacheco, John Robertson, Ronald Ishii

Our objective is to construct a predictive model that leverages historical SPY stock data to generate timely trading signals (buy, hold, sell) that capitalize on market movements. 

This model will utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools, including BigQuery, Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Looker Studio, to analyze and execute trades based on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (SPY) data.
