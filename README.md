# Leveraging GCP to Analyze and Predict the S&P 500

## Capstone Project: Data Driven Solutions with Google Cloud Platform 
**Group 6 - John Kreider, Jacob Michaels, Daelano Pacheco, John Robertson, Ronald Ishii**

**Objective**:
Successfully integrate at least three GCP technologies into Data Studio where both archived and real-time data sources are analyzed to provide insights and actionable solutions.

**Problem Domain:** 
The target domain is the financial sector, however the model generated could be applied to other sectors which similarly are looking for a signal on what actions to take given historical context.

**Data Source:**
Data comes from Yahoo Finance's archive of the SPY ETF. SPY is the ticker symbol for the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust which looks to mirror the S&P 500®. This ticker symbol effectively acts as a proxy to the overall market and will allow for a robust analysis.

**Analysis Goals:**
The goal of our analysis is to construct a predictive model that leverages historical SPY stock data to generate timely trading signals (buy, hold, sell) that capitalize on market movements. 

This model will utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools, including BigQuery, Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Looker Studio, to analyze and execute trades based on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (SPY) data.
